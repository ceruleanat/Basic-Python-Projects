#
# Purpose:      A basic tool that identifies all .txt files in
#               a chosen directory and moves them to a new one.
#               It then creates a database and inserts the file
#               name and time (getmtime) of modification.
#
# Tested OS:  This code was written and tested to work with Windows 10
#
# =====================================================================
